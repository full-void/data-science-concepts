# Data Science Concepts
-----------------------

This repository contains notebooks detailing Data Science Concepts and my notes. 

It should be useful for both a quick review and a reference to fall back upon.

The details in the notebooks discussed are:

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This notebook details some exploratory data analysis approaches. I also go through a realworld database on cars and conduct the analysis to find important variables to predict price. Specifically, it talks about:

* Loading data and finding important metadata about column types.
* Finding relationship between numerical data using Pearson correlation.
    - Visualising relationship using regression plots.
* Finding relationship between numerical and categorical data.
    - Using boxplots to visualize the data.
    - Conducting ANOVA analysis to check for statistically significant relationship.
* Descriptive Statistical Analysis
    - Using pandas' `describe()` method to get important statistics such as 5 number summary and other statistically important values.
    - Finding counts of unique values and making decisions on legibility of the data.
* Grouping of the data.
    - Finding important information such as means of the data divided by groups.
    - Visualizing using Heatmaps
* P-values and correlation

## Data Wrangling

This notebook contains concepts and notes on data wrangling: preparing data for further analysis and model development. Specifically, it discusses:

* Setting Headers
* Correcting the Data
    - Identifying the missing values
        + Converting other markers (such as ?) to NAN
        + Analysing for missing data
    - Dealing with missing values
        + Dropping data
        + Replacing data with mean and frequency
    - Correcting the data format
* Data Standardization
* Data Noramalization
* Binning
    - Visualizing Bins
* Encoding Categorical Variables
    - Label Encoding
    - One-hot Encoding

## SQL and Pandas

This notebook details some important and commonly used information on Pandas Python Library and SQL. Specifically, it talks about:

* Connecting to a database with Magic Commands in IPython SQL Interface.
* Reading the dataset.
* Storing the dataset in a database.
* Getting data from database and converting it to a pandas dataframe.
* Filtering data with multiple and single conditions (both Pandas and SQL)
* High-level description of data (Pandas and SQL)
* Sorting (Pandas and SQL)
* Useful Pandas functions
