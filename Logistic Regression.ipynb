    "# What is Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is an algorithm that is used in classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference from Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It is different from Linear Regression because it uses a sigmoid function instead of a linear line. While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, **y**, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function 𝜎:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ℎ_\\theta(𝑥) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) =  \\frac {e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +\\cdots)}}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, ${\\theta^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $\\sigma(\\theta^TX)$ is the sigmoid or [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork-20718538&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork-20718538&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork-20718538&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ&cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork-20718538&cm_mmca1=000026UJ&cm_mmca2=10006555&cm_mmca3=M12345678&cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&cvo_campaign=000026UJ), also called logistic curve.

    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One of the simplest** machine learning algorithms and is easy to implement yet provides great training efficiency in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Doesn't require high computation power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The predicted parameters (trained weights) **give inference about the importance of each feature.** The direction of association i.e. positive or negative is also given. So we can use logistic regression to find out the relationship between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows models to be **updated easily to reflect new data**, unlike decision trees or support vector machines. The update can be done using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression **outputs well-calibrated probabilities** along with classification results. This is an advantage over models that only give the final classification as results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a **low dimensional dataset** having a sufficient number of training examples, logistic regression is **less prone to over-fitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rather than straight away starting with a complex model, logistic regression is sometimes **used as a benchmark model to measure performance**, as it is relatively quick and easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression proves to be **very efficient when the dataset has features that are linearly separable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This algorithm **can easily be extended to multi-class classification** using a softmax classifier, this is known as Multinomial Logistic Regression."

   "source": [
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic regression fails to predict a continuous outcome.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **On high dimensional datasets**, this may lead to the model being **over-fit** on the training set. This usually happens in the case when the model is trained on **little training data with lots of features**. So on high dimensional datasets, **Regularization techniques should be considered** to avoid over-fitting (but this makes the model complex). Very high regularization factors may even lead to the model being under-fit on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non linear problems can't be solved** with logistic regression since it has a linear decision surface. Linearly separable data is rarely found in real world scenarios. So the transformation of non linear features is required which can be done by increasing the number of features such that the data becomes linearly separable in higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is **difficult to capture complex relationships** using logistic regression. More powerful and complex algorithms such as Neural Networks can easily outperform this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression **requires moderate or no multicollinearity** between independent variables. Multicollinearity can be removed using dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Linear Regression independent and dependent variables should be related linearly. But Logistic Regression **requires that independent variables are linearly related to the log odds** (log(p/(1-p)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Only important and relevant features should be used** to build a model otherwise the probabilistic predictions made by the model may be incorrect and the model's predictive value may degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The presence of data values that deviate from the expected range in the dataset may lead to incorrect results as this algorithm is **sensitive to outliers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression **requires a large dataset** and also sufficient training examples for all the categories it needs to identify."
